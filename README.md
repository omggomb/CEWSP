#CEWSP

CEWSP (**C** ry **E** ngine **W** ork **SP** ace) is a small development tool that aims to improve the everyday development experience with the CRYENGINE Free SDK. 
It is mainly meant to serve as file organisation utility which helps you to keep an overview over the files created while developing with CRYENGINE. 
It features tools to reorganise and create any kind of assetfile while easily navigating through the CRYENGINE directory.

##Compiling

Should compile out of the box (.NET Framework 4.5 required). Created with SharpDevelop, tested with VS 2012 Express.

##Want to help?

Great! You're welcome to join in. I think especially the user interface would benefit from being rewritten by a WPF pro ;).

##License

Do what you want with the binary and source code.
