==============
Alpha build 4:
==============

Add:
 - Shortcuts to the left of the main window
 - Support for profiles
	- Different working directories can now be switched to with 2 mouse clicks
 - Drag zone dialog now remembers last path used
 - If root directory is changed, gamefolders are searched and the first one found will be suggested to be used (looks for game.cfg, ignoring "USER" folders)
 - Once a quick access button has started a process, the process can be killed by right clicking the button and choosing Kill process


Change:
 - Swapped old file explorer for new, better one (now it doesn't collapse on file changes anymore, yay)
	- Now shows file and folder icons
	- Items are now selectable by rightclicking
	- Pressing a letter will cycle through all entries of the selected item's parent
	- Directories are no longer traveled at startup but rather as needed
	  Note that this induces a slight lag when opening directories with lots of files (e.g. code)
 - Program definitions and user settings are stored inside the CEWSP directory, essentially making it portable
   on an usb stick (you can use different profiles for different working machines) 
 - Removed the need for paths to be CE conform in order to simplify usage with EaaS. The user will still be (annoyed) reminded very
 	often , since using a non CE conform path will eventually lead to issues.
 - Made warning about non CE conform path optional, user editable setting (becomes annoying really fast, talk about consistency...)
    Will still be displayed on startup but not at runtime anymore
 

==============
Alpha build 3:
==============

Add:
- F2 in file explorer triggers rename
- Ctrl c, v, x in file explorer 
- Setting: Choose which directories the source tracker will watch (game, root, both, none);
- Setting: Command line arguments for game / editor quick access buttons and code + script buttons
- Copying directories in fileexplorer now works
- Setting: GFXExporter relative path
- Setting: Check ignored files file for sanity on startup (will still be checked if the file is changed
	through the Tools menu)

Change:
- Ignored files are defined through regexps now
- pasting inside the file explorer now runs through all files in clipboard
- Dragzone dialog now can handle arbitrary numbers of files and folders
- Defaulted "Run RC" to false in dragzone dialog.

Fix:
- Errors while copying files in file explorer won't crash CEWSP anymore.
- Ignored paths and negated ignored paths are handled in the correct way now.
- Access problems when dumping currently tracked files to file, are handled or forwarded to the user.

==============
Alpha build 2:
==============

Add:
- "Set CE Rootdir" and "Set Gamefolder" now have colored backgrounds that indicate their validness
- Submenu "Run with..." inside treeview context menu
- Run with gfxexporter in tree view context menu "Run with..."
- Treeview hotkey "DELETE" will delete selectet item
- Support for new macro "$CEWSP_CURRENT_FILE_NAME", which represents the file name of the file
- Support for new macro "$CEWSP_CURRENT_FILE", which represents the absolute path to the current file
- Support for new macro "$CEWSP_CURRENT_FOLDER", which represents the absolute path to the current folder
- "Run..." submenu inside "Tools" context menu, runs any predefined program
- "Open in explorer" to tree view context menu
- Tree view now listens for directory and file changes and updates automatically
- Quick access buttons will only be enabled if their specified files actually exist
- Treeview now keeps last selected item open if possible
- Using "Track file" on a directory will track all files inside it
- Setting: Verbose import, export

++++ Internal
- New utility class CProcessUtils, CUserInteractionUtils
- CPathUitls.GetFilename
- CUserInteractionUtils.AskUserToEnterString
- SStartupFile name property
- SDCCProgram name property
- CSetting UserEditable property

Change:
- Manage program definitions dialog redesign to reflect new complexity
- If "launch with program" is not checked no program will be launched (prevously program without arguments)
- "Track file" in file explorer context menu now ignores Ignorefiles.txt, forcing the selected file to be tracked
- Import / export will only inform the user if verbose is set to true, but will always write messages to log
++++ Internal
- Moved RunRC, RunRCTif inside own class (CProcessUtils)
- Renamed CDCCDefinition.m_sRootPathMakro to m_sRootPathMacro
- Renamed CDCCDefinition.m_sGameFolderMakro to m_sGameFolderMakcro
- Renamed CDCCDefinition.ExpandMakros to ExpandMacros

Fix:
- only startup files that contain macros are modified, as
  modifying all files caused issues with binary files.
- various try catch statements to catch file errors
- Missing application settings will no longer cause an application shutdown
- Dragzone dialog will no longer close down if an invalid path is specified
- Settings won't be lost on crash anymore
- Copying directories with drag zone dialog now works
